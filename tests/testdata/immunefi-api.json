For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.","programType":["Smart Contract","Websites and Applications"],"project":"Hourglass","projectType":["NFT"],"rewardsBody":"__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $50,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with $5,000 USD, only if the impact leads to:\n\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of $1,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $5,000 to $10,000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.","rewardsPool":0,"rewardsToken":"USDC","slug":"hourglass","tenPercentEconomicRule":false,"updatedDate":"2024-11-28T12:50:04.715Z","impactsBody":null,"websiteUrl":null,"githubUrl":null,"eligibilityCriteria":["no_ofac_sdn","no_official_contributor","no_auditor","no_employee"],"responsiblePublicationCategory":"category_2","description":"Hourglass is a protocol that facilitates liquidity for time-bound and semi-fungible tokens.","knownIssues":[],"defaultOutOfScopeBlockchain":null,"defaultOutOfScopeSmartContract":"- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n  - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks","defaultOutOfScopeWebAndApplications":"- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim\n- Reflected plain text injection (e.g. url parameters, path, etc.)\n  - This does not exclude reflected HTML injection with or without JavaScript\n  - This does not exclude persistent plain text injection\n- Any impacts involving self-XSS\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)\n- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact\n- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants\n- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Impacts that only require DDoS\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass)\n- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records)\n- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact\n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering","defaultOutOfScopeGeneral":"- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (including, but not limited to: governance and strategist contracts) without additional modifications to the privileges attributed\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n- Impacts requiring phishing or other social engineering attacks against project's employees and/or customers","defaultFeasibilityLimitations":"The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world.

Messages are routed from chain to chain by a decentralised group of guardian nodes who sign attestations of on-chain state.\n\nFor more information about Wormhole, please visit [https://wormhole.com/](https://wormhole.com/).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on the prevention of negative impacts to Wormhole and the Portal Token Bridge, which currently covers their smart contracts, guardian nodes, and Wormhole integrations with blockchains.\n\n\n__Submission Requirements__\nAll reports must come with sufficient explanation and data to easily reproduce the bug, e.g. through a proof-of-concept code.\n\nFor a bug report to be paid, we do require the bug reporter to comply with our KYC requirements.\n\nThis includes the following:\n  - Wallet address where you’ll receive payment\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with your address or a recent utility bill with your name, address, and issuer of the bill)\n  - Copy of your passport will be required.\n  - W rewards are limited to those persons who are (a) not U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Regulation S”) (b) is not domiciled in or has their principal place of business in the United States; (y) will conduct all transactions with the Tokens outside the United States and solely with non-US persons; and (z) is not acquiring the Tokens for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person and will not engage in any directed selling efforts in the United States.\n  - Any and all W to which you are entitled to receive as reward will only be granted and delivered to you upon the execution by you of a Restricted Token Grant Agreement in the form required by Wormhole Foundation and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, including a lock-up on the W token as set forth therein.\n  - You shall be responsible for reporting and paying any current and future taxes that it may incur resulting from the grant or delivery of any W or cash compensation\n  - If you report a critical bounty that has a reward denominated in W you may be entitled to receive the reward in USDC at 25% of the reward value if you are unable to receive the reward in W.","programType":["Blockchain/DLT","Smart Contract"],"project":"Wormhole","projectType":["Blockchain","Infrastructure"],"rewardsBody":"- __Tier 1:__ Ability to Extract the TVL of all chains: Up to 20,000,000 W\n- __Tier 2:__ Ability to Extract the TVL of a single chain: Up to 10,000,000 W \n- __Tier 3:__ Ability to permanently deny access to the TVL of one or many chains: Up to 5,000,000 W \n\nPlease note that for any valid Critical severity reports, the maximum reward will be up to $5,000,000 USD, paid in W token.\n\nAll rewards are decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself if it is nondeterministic or some of the conditions are not present at the time. The rewards presented in the payout structure above are the maximum rewards and there are no minimum rewards.\n\nRewards for critical vulnerabilities are further capped at __10%__ of extractable value during a 24h period (see Governor mechanism: [https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0007_governor.md)](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0007_governor.md). Rewards for vulnerabilities resulting in the indefinite locking of funds are further capped at __1%__ of destroyable value. Rewards for critical vulnerabilities relating to NFTs are further capped at 80,000 W.\n\nValue is calculated based on the current market value and available liquidity for widely-used tokens in the Portal Token Bridge, e.g. ETH and SOL. \n\nIn cases where the report achieves more than one of the above objectives, rewards will be tiered to the higher of the two objectives and will not be aggregated (eg. if you have the ability to extract and brick a complete TVL for a chain, you will be awarded a bounty as if you were able to only extract the complete TVL for that chain).\n\nRewards for bugs in dependencies and third party code are at the discretion of the Wormhole team and will be based on the impact demonstrated on Wormhole. If the dependency has its own bug bounty program, your reward for submitting this vulnerability to Wormhole will be lowered by the expected payout of that other program. If the vulnerability is in a connected blockchain itself rather than the Wormhole code, the locked and wrapped assets on that chain are not included in the impact calculation.\n\nWormhole Foundation will maintain full discretion on the payouts for vulnerabilities. We do encourage bug reporters to submit issues outside of the above-mentioned payout structure, though we want to be clear that we’ll exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis -- whether an issue warrants a payout and what that ultimate payout would be.","rewardsPool":0,"rewardsToken":"","slug":"wormhole","tenPercentEconomicRule":false,"updatedDate":"2024-11-28T11:20:34.788Z","impactsBody":"The Governor module ([https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/dev.v2/node/pkg/governor](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/dev.v2/node/pkg/governor)) is designed to limit the value that can be transferred out of one chain over time.

[https://github.com/shardeum/](https://github.com/shardeum/).\n\n__Mid-Contest Code Updates__\n\nIn this contest bug fixes may be applied mid-contest. This is required for Shardeum to test changes on their beta networks in preparation for an imminent mainnet launch.\n\nThe project is to keep changes private as far as possible. When changes need to be made public, then the changelog will be updated here & in the [Shardeum Audit Competition Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/immunefi?utm_source=immunefi). Publicly fixed bugs are invalid and the scope is updated to the new code.\n\nAll bug reports before the fix was public will earn a reward. All bug reports after are invalid. If a new bug is introduced by their fix then it is valid for a reward.\n\n__Mid-Contest Changelog__\n\nCurrently none.\n\nPOCs should be tested against the most recent changes on the /tree/dev github repo.\n\n__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nShardeum commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Shardeum will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nShardeum adheres to the Primacy of Impact for all impacts.\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Shardeum has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).","boostedIntroEvaluating":"","boostedIntroFinished":"Audit Competition cards for security researchers with paid reports are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10zwZIGt0QMig_FJrHhkTztIxN57RnanT?usp=sharing)\n\nAll paid bug reports are available in original format [here](https://reports.immunefi.com/shardeum-ancillaries-ii)","boostedIntroLive":"$100,000 USD is available in rewards for finding bugs in Shardeum's codebase of about 27000 nSLOC.

This will cover three components: The validator GUI, validator CLI, Archive Server, and the RPC server.\n\nFor more information about Shardeum, please visit [https://shardeum.org/](https://shardeum.org/).\n\nShardeum provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.","programType":["Websites and Applications"],"project":"Audit Comp | Shardeum: Ancillaries II","projectType":["Blockchain"],"rewardsBody":"The following reward terms are a summary, for the full details read our [Shardeum Ancillaries II Audit Competition Reward Terms](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/28077740315537-Shardeum-Ancillaries-II-Audit-Competition-Reward-Terms)\n\nThe reward pool will be entirely distributed among participants. The size depends on the bugs found:\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 100% of the respective reward pool, $100,000 USD**\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 75% of the respective reward pool, $75,000 USD**\n- If one or more Medium severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 50% of the respective reward pool, $50,000 USD**\n- If Low severity bugs or no bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 25% of the respective reward pool, $25,000 USD**\n\n**Duplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward.**\n\nFor this Audit Competition, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools according to their severity level without any downgrade.

Archivers will not be public at launch\n     - Priv escalation in RPC\n\n- **Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?**\n     - Archiver and RPC server. We want them to break all of it obviously but we believe these two components need more attention\n\n__Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nThe default config in the dev branch is in scope. Whitehats are free to configure, patch, and modify their own malicious hosts however they want. However, target service must be running the default config in dev. This is to prevent the whitehats from wasting time reporting things we specifically allow in debug mode. If the researchers can enable debug mode options remotely then that is valid and can be paid out.\n\nAttacks that require the network to still be initializing/bootstrapping are out of scope. Wait until the network mode reaches “processing” + 15 cycles after startup before launching attacks. The rules for staking/join are a little different and the network will not be public during this time. Attacks on a network that is repairing itself (was once in “processing” mode but has since degraded to “safety” or “recovery”) are in scope.\n\nAttacks that require lots of network traffic, large messages, or many connections are at risk of being degraded to insight.\n\n0day vulnerabilities in dependencies will have a max impact of insight. Any other vuln in dependencies is out of scope.\n\nAny report based on unit tests, simulations, or anything not a fully functioning service, will have a max impact of low.\n\nSmart contracts and smart contract related code/functions are out of scope\n\nFinally, the more nodes that are required to launch an attack, the more at risk the vuln is of being downgraded. If it takes 33% (for example) of the nodes in the network being malicious to cause damage, then it becomes difficult to distinguish the impact from a brute-force/51% attack, which is completely out of scope.\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?__\n\nThe archive server is designed to store the history of the network. Archivers are not a part of the core protocol, do not have any part in consensus, and do not affect joining/rotation. Another quirk is that currently, the transaction history is not chained. The cycle certificates are chained which contains information like joined and lost nodes per cycle, active nodes, archiver list, standby list, etc. The transaction history will have a Merkle root published while the chaining is developed.\n\n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\nHere is a helpful PoC scaffolding. Even though it targets the Core II audit competition, it may still be helpful here\n\n[https://gist.github.com/kun6fup4nd4/162d491e07d0a84344abbf33bc602502](https://gist.github.com/kun6fup4nd4/162d491e07d0a84344abbf33bc602502)\n\nRPC: [https://github.com/shardeum/json-rpc-server/tree/localtest#running-tests](https://github.com/shardeum/json-rpc-server/tree/localtest#running-tests)\n\nArchiver: No specific doc, however an archiver is launched with the local network when following the directions here: [https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-network-locally](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-network-locally).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program.
