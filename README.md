# Legion

![Tests](https://github.com/muellerberndt/Legion/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Legion is an AI-driven framework that automates Web3 bug hunting workflows. It tracks ongoing bug bounties and contests and launches autonomous agents that can perform arbitrary tasks, such as assessing code revisions and upgrades, evaluating on-chain and off-chain events, searching code for potential bugs, or whatever else the security researcher desires. 

The Legion framework ships with basic functionality. By [extending Legion](docs/customization.md), you can enhance the capabilities of your agents and implement your own "alpha" strategies that you might not be willing to share. Some ideas:

- Intelligently prioritize targets using code complexity analysis & EV estimation (payouts, estimated competition, etc.)
- Distill bug patterns from newly released reports to search for similar bugs in your scope
- Gap analysis in tests suites & automated Foundry test generation to find missing edge cases
- (... the list goes on)

The base framework contains the following features:

- Telegram chatbot interface
- Auto-sync data and code from Immunefi bounties
- Search bounty data, files and repos using regex & vector search
- Auto-review of PRs and commits in GitHub repos in scope
- Auto-review of proxy implementation upgrades in scope (see [example extension](extensions/examples/proxy_upgrade_review.py))
- Launch agents on demand or schedule them to run at specific intervals
- Simple semgrep scanning (see [example extension](extensions/examples/simple_semgrep.py))

## Running Legion

You need to set up a Telegram bot, a Postgres database and several API keys first ([Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)).

To start the server, run:

```bash
./legion.sh server start --log-level INFO
```

You can then talk to the bot via Telegram:

Have any assets on Etherscan been added to bounty scopes recently? Or updated? If so please list me the URLs along with the project names.

ü§î I need to find recently updated or added assets of type 'deployed_contract' and join them with their respective project names.

üõ†Ô∏è Executing: /db_query '{"from": "assets", "join": {"table": "projects", "on": {"project_id": "id"}}, "where": [{"field": "asset_type", "op": "=", "value": "deployed_contract"}], "order_by": [{"field": "assets.updated_at", "direction": "desc"}], "select": ["assets.source_url", "projects.name"], "limit": 10}'

Here are the recently updated deployed contracts on Etherscan along with their project names:

1. Project: eBTC
   URL: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd366e016Ae0677CdCE93472e603b75051E022AD0#code

2. Project: eBTC
   URL: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6dBDB6D420c110290431E863A1A978AE53F69ebC#code

Thanks! Can you please run semgrep on the first one

ü§î The user wants to run a semgrep scan on the first asset. I need to execute the semgrep command using the asset ID of the first URL provided.
üõ†Ô∏è Executing: /semgrep 4051

The semgrep scan on the first asset (https://etherscan.io/address/0xd366e016Ae0677CdCE93472e603b75051E022AD0#code) completed successfully with no issues found.
